Here's the complete list of steps for building a Linux kernel using BitBake, including the additional steps:

  1. `do_fetch`: This step downloads the source code for the kernel.
  2. `do_unpack`: This step unpacks the downloaded source code.
  3. `do_patch`: This step applies any patches to the source code.
  4. `do_validate_branches`: This step validates the branches in the kernel source code and checks for any conflicts or errors.
  5. `do_kernel_checkout`: This step checks out a specific version or branch of the kernel source code from a version control system like Git.
  6. `do_kernel_metadata`: This step generates metadata for the kernel, such as information about its configuration and dependencies.
  7. `do_configure`: This step sets up the kernel configuration file and runs the make menuconfig or make config command to configure the kernel for building.
  8. `do_compile`: This step compiles the source code into a binary format.
  9. `do_install`: This step installs the compiled kernel binary and its associated files into the target filesystem.
  10. `do_build`: This step combines the previous steps, do_compile and do_install, into one step.
  11. `do_package`: This step packages the installed files into a distributable format, such as a .deb or .rpm file.
  12. `do_package_write_*`: This step writes the distributable package to disk.
